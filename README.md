# 30-UIUX-design-projects
A collection of UI/UX projects that I've completed. I'll update when I can

I'm using https://www.uidesigndaily.com/ and https://dribbble.com/ to get some ideas about how to increase my UI/UX Experience. This is just for fun, but I really like to see the results as they come out. 

Most of the code is #HTML and #CSS but some does include #JS 
- as a future project, it would be easy to combine and modify later when my JS skills are up to snuff
